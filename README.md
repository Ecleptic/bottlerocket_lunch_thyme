#### About Google Maps:

I have downloaded the npm module, `google-maps-react` however it's 46k unzipped, so I'm not certain I want to use it

I am struggling with Avenir Next is an apple only font, so should I use a webfont? Should we buy it as a company? Should we take the one I have and make it a webfont? I don't know.

## Responsive Design

The responsive length is set at `640px` in width. It was originally `700px`, however the images are downloaded at `640 x 360 px` and I didn't want to push it past its default resolution.
